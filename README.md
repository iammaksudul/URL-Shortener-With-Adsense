## **📜 Installation Guide**
Follow these steps to set up your **PHP URL Shortener**:

### **🔹 Step 1: Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/iammaksudul/URL-Shortener-With-Adsense.git
cd URL-Shortener-With-Adsense
```

### **🔹 Step 2: Set Up Your Database**
1. **Create a MySQL database** in your hosting panel.
2. **Import `database.sql`** (located in the project folder) into MySQL.
3. **Update `db.php`** with your database credentials:
```php
$servername = "your_database_host";  // Usually 'localhost'
$username = "your_database_username";
$password = "your_database_password";
$dbname = "your_database_name";
$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);
```

### **🔹 Step 3: Configure AdSense**
1. Open `adsense_config.php`.
2. Replace the existing AdSense script with **your own AdSense code**:
```html
<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4452711820150477"
     crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```
3. **Ensure your AdSense account is active** and has approved ads.

### **🔹 Step 4: Upload to Hosting Server**
1. **Upload all project files** to your **public_html** or **server root directory**.
2. Make sure **mod_rewrite** is enabled for clean URL redirections.
3. Set file permissions correctly (if needed).

## **💰 How the Monetization Works**
This URL shortener is optimized to **earn from AdSense ads** by showing advertisements before redirecting the user:
1️⃣ User enters a long URL → Clicks **Shorten**  
2️⃣ A **short link** is generated  
3️⃣ When the user clicks the short link:  
   - They land on a **waiting page with AdSense ads**  
   - A **mini-game keeps them engaged** while ads load  
   - After a **timer countdown**, they are **redirected**  

✅ **This method maximizes ad revenue by increasing ad impressions and reducing bounce rates.**  

---

## **🔧 Customization**
Want to customize your **waiting page, game, or ad placements**?  
- **Modify `redirect.php`** to change the **waiting period, animations, or countdown**.  
- **Edit `game.js`** to add different **mini-games or engagement features**.  
- **Update CSS (`styles.css`)** for a fresh **UI redesign**.  

---

## **🛠 Future Updates**
✅ **Analytics Dashboard** – Track click counts, referrers, and conversion rates 📊  
✅ **Admin Panel** – Manage short links, users, and revenue 🚀  
✅ **User Accounts** – Allow users to register and manage their short links 🔐  
✅ **QR Code Generator** – Generate QR codes for each shortened URL 📱
